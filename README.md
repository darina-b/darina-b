Well hellooooo there 👋 I'm Darina, nice to meet you too!
I'm a fresh Data Engineer with developed Data Analytics skills. 
Passionate about Data and continuous self-development and currently looking for projects where I can help.

I stand out due to this fortunate combo: 
+ inborn analytical thinking
+ efficiency as a lifestyle
+ excellent communication
  
I thrive on challenges and believe that everything is 'figureoutable'. So, the trickier the task, the more fun for me.

My current set of skills includes (but is not limited to!😎):
- Python (advanced, incl. pandas, numpy, matplotlib etc.)
- SQL
- Power BI
- PostgreSQL
- Microsoft Excel
- Git
- PostgreSQL
- IBM Db2
- Jupyter Notebook
- Azure services
- working on it every day...stay tuned😁

*Fun fact: I'm a career changer, after 15 years in Architecture I realized that Data is much more fun for me (alas! it did not exist in my teens).
Then, I started learning like crazy..and am absolutely enjoying it till today! 
So, if your project is related to real estate or urban planning, we have more in common than you'd expect!
